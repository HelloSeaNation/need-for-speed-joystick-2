		Please follow the troubleshooting steps:
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <ol>
        
        <li><u>If you have just updated the app to a new version</u>, 
please make sure that you update the server software as well. To do 
this, visit our website: phonegamesoftware.cn, then scroll to the bottom
 of the page and click on the download button for the OS you are 
running. You may need uninstall the previous version first.
        </li>
        <br>
        
        <li>Have you installed the server software on your computer and 
followed the instructions on our web site to set it up? If not, please 
read the support section under www.phonegamesoftware.cn for information 
on how to install and configure the server.
        </li>
        <br>

        
        <li>Do you have any firewalls enabled? If you have a firewall, 
even if you added an exception for Need For Speed Joystick, please disable it 
temporarily to see if that is the problem. Afterwards, you may enable it
 again and add an exception if that was the problem.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Do you have any antivirus software installed on your 
computer? If so, please disable it temporarily to see if that is 
blocking it. Afterwards, you may enable it again and add an exception if
 that was the problem.  Please consult the documentation for your 
antivirus software for how to add an exception.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Is your iPhone connected to a WIFI network? Please make sure that the WIFI icon is showing in the status bar on your iPhone.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Is your iPhone connected to the same WIFI network as your 
computer? Please make sure that the name of the server selected on your 
iPhone is the same as the network selected on your computer.</li>

        <br>
        <li>The server may be using a port number that is in use or 
higher than what your computer allows. Please open the  server settings 
and try changing the port to 9099 and hit apply.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Are you on a public, work, or university network? If so, 
some of these networks may not allow the server to work or may require 
entering your IP manually.  To try this, please open the server settings
 as well as the settings on the iPhone app.  Enter the IP address and 
port that is showing on the server into the IP and port fields on the 
iPhone app.</li>
        <br>
         <li>If you are still unable to connect, please try setting up 
an ad hoc network. Visit our website for instructions on how to do this.</li>
        <br>
